About the Project:

Designed an entity-relationship model to store the JSON data about Nobel Prizes and laureates, their affiliations, and dates and
place of birth.
Cleaned JSON data by creating a parser using the Python Filesystem API to convert JSON objects to del files for each SQL table.
Used mySQL DDL queries to create tables and used PHP to create a web interface to filter and pull data about each laureate from
the database using SQL queries.
